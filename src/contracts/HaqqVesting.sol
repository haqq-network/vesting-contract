/*
* @title HaqqVesting
* This smart contract allows making deposits with 'vesting', i.e. each deposit can be repaid to beneficiary in
* fixed amount of portions (defined in 'numberOfPayments' variable), each payment will be unblocked after fixed period
* of time (defined in 'timeBetweenPayments' variable).
* Payments can be cumulative. That is, if the time has passed for which the beneficiary could have already received
* three payments, then the current transfer will pay the amount of three payments.
* Any address can make a deposit, and any address can trigger next payment to beneficiary.
* There can be many deposits for the same beneficiary address.
